            <p><strong>Fast and Secure CPU Inference: TensorflowServing Inside Intel SGX</strong> - developed a
              container serving a ResNET-based landmark detection model from within an Intel SGX enclave.
              The line of research was to address the protection of AI models, with SGX providing some protection
              against memory-dumping attacks.
              Performance within enclave was reasonable (within a small constant factor).
              Transport from client to server was protected using mutual-TLS, with both REST and gRpc API.
              80ms/inference.
              The application included included a python Flask frontend allowing the user to upload a landmark to
              identify and performing an inference. Produced builds with AVX2 optimizations.
              The path to Tensorflow-Serving in SGX included development of Tensorflow container that supported running
              nearly all of upstream Tensorflow.</p>
            <p>
              Docker container developments included the Docker-ization of an existing Intel SGX-based HSM application,
              an authserver using this HSM,
              a Tensorflow object-detection Jupyter notebook in both cpu and gpu variants, a Mozilla DeepSpeech(ASR, an
              implementation of Baidu's DeepSpeech) container, a Tensorflow SpeechCommands demo.</p>
            <p>Other developments included:
            <ul>
              <li>Making a Tensorflow model for natural-language processing servable using            <li>Coffee</li>

              While at Postmedia, I delivered a Google Adwords REST service that was responsible for pulling, storing
              and summarizing our client's Adwords data. The implementation was in Typescript, Mongodb, Express, and was
              written
              making heavy use of javascript's concurrency features (both Promises and callback-driven concurrency). The
              implementation satisfied Google's Required Minimum Functionality for Adwords and allowed us to
              successfully apply for
              and obtain Standard api access.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also delivered a Google DoubleClick BidManager REST service. The implementation was noteworthy for
              allowing for the streaming and chunked consumption of large csv report files produced by Google (in the gb
              range). Nodejs
              streams and concurrency features formed the backbone.
            </p>
            <p>I contributed to the Reporting functionality, writing the backend REST service allowing for report
              creation and storage. Implemented .xls and .csv report output.</p>

              While at Auvik, I contributed heavily to the proprietary networking programming language npl. Initially, I
              wrote a code-generating compiler that took in Auvik's proprietary network programming language (npl) files
              and
              generated a database schema structures in the implementation language (scala). This compiler was
              implemented as a stage in the compilation process, integrating with the build tool sbt, and implemented a
              file-caching scheme
              that avoided unnecessary compilation work. Other contributions to the language included compilation passes
              implementing error handling(Option-lifting) and language primitives for sorting and ordering.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote and implemented networking protocols (tftp and telnet). The implementations respected IEFC RFC
              specifications, and implementated both client and server-side functionality allowing clients to perform
              telnet and tftp
              operations within a web console.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              I designed and contributed the initial clustering architecture, consisting of a seed node, backend and
              frontend node type. The implementation utilized Akka Cluster, and ran on aws at scale. Contributions were
              also made to
              the Amazon cloud formation templates necessary to create a cluster. I was primarily responsible for
              packaging the scala and java code, and produced .deb packages suitable for installation on Ubuntu.
            </p>
            <p>To produce a responsive frontend experience, I implemented compression between our frontend server and
              the client. I also contributed the compilation pipeline that compressed, minified and concatenated our
              assets.</p>

              At D2L, I worked with a select group of high-profile clients providing a paid-premium service. As TAM,
              built the client-company relationship as the client's primary contact within the Desire2Learn Customer
              Support division.
              I had the distinction of being the first individual in this role. For work on behalf of clients, received
              a D2L Superstar award nomination for work improving semester start up experience for a large
              post-secondary school
              consortium. A large part of the job was to provide interventions on the client's behalf from within the
              Customer Support division. Interventions ranged from strictly technical to introduction of new process and
              procedure.
              This necessitated interacting with Technical Services, Product Development, SaaS Operations divisions to
              provide prompt resolution to software, hardware issues and service disruptions.
            </p>

            <p>
              I advised clients with respect to implementation of new initiatives designed to improve user experience,
              to mitigate persistent issues, and in planning and implementing software updates and problem hotfixes.
              Thanks to this
              involvement, I attained a deep understanding of problems and issues facing customers within the
              educational-tech sector, with a focus on university and post-secondary client issues.
            </p>
            <p>I also provided on-call and after hours support to clients.</p>

              Updated the <strong>FrTime language</strong>, an embedding of functional reactive programming (FRP), from MzScheme to the newer Racket programming language. The work, merged in Racket 5.3.1, included significant updates to macros, higher-order functions, and continuations in a large, complex software ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project provided experience with software maintenance and working within existing codebases. It also involved making smaller contributions to other Racket sub-languages.
